# WSE380_LinearForces

## This repository is meant to be a basic introduction for simulation the motion of particles experiencing a linear forces of the form $` F=-kx `$, which are often referred to as restoring forces. Since this will be the first time using Python for some people, I have took the liberty of including a block of code to automatically install all the necessary libraries required to run the code.

## One file contains a basic introduction to Python syntax, math operators and functions. 

## The second file is a Jupyter Notebook which contains all the math and physics of simulating linear restoring forces for two cases: a mass on a spring, and a pendulum. Interactive elements and animations are included to help you visualize the motion of these systems.
